For example, if I created a function in the JS file called \"viaBackgroundColorChange\" and wanted it to be called \"viaColorChange\" in the HTML file, it would look like:</p> <pre><code>function viaColorChange() {\n  // my code here\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {..., viaColorChange: viaBackgroundColorChange};\n</code></pre> <p>Then, to call this function in the HTML, you first have to refer to the bundle that is exported by browserify. If you use the command below it will be called the generatorBundle. Continuing with the example from above, to call viaColorChange, you would do something:</p> <pre><code>&lt;button type=\"button\" onclick=\"generatorBundle.viaColorChange()\"&gt;Click here!&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre>","location":"assets/javascript/"},{"title":"Bundling and Running","text":"<p>After editing the naval_letter.js file to add in any functionality, you then need to bundle this prior to running/serving it on the webserver.

IC4 requests each MEF to assemble, and authorize the duty efforts of, one Coding Team from their cadre of technically skilled personnel to research, engineer, test, and deploy a micro-software application that will either reduce operational friction, optimize workflow, increase Unit Readiness, or alleviate administrative burdens across any warfighting function.  MEF Coding Teams will be authorized to utilize Marine Corps resources such as time, equipment, and facilities. Furthermore, the MEF Coding Teams will utilize the Marine Corps Business Optimization Support Services (MCBOSS) Development-Security-Operations (DevSecOps) ecosystem to rapidly develop software in support of the challenge.  This challenge tests the theory that, given the right resources, talented Marines across the MOS spectrum can design and deliver software capabilities that can enable and expand efficiencies from tactical to strategic level.

Second, this partnership allows us to move from an active duty centric model to a full range of employment through the reserves. We are excited with what we can accomplish in 2022 and beyond. Third, MIU Marine Coders will work under a force provider model.
